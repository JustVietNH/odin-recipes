    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Broth</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean the pork and chicken bones thoroughly. To clean the bones, fill a large stock pot with enough water that would cover bones without overflowing. Bring water to a boil. Add bones and cook for 5 minutes. Pour content of pot into a colander and rinse bones with cold water. If you are going to re-use the pot for stock, make sure to clean the pot thoroughly too.</li>

            <li>In a stock pot, add 6 liters water and cleaned bones. Bring pot to a boil.</li>
        
            <li>Add dried shrimp, squid, roasted onions and roasted shallots (remove any burnt peels from the roasted onions and shallots before adding to stock).</li>
        
            <li>Cook 2 to 2.5 hours on medium low heat, occasionally skim the surface of the stock to keep the broth clear.</li>
        
            <li>Season with rock sugar, salt and MSG.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Assembly</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To each bowl, add about 1/2 cup egg noodles and 3-5 wontons.</li>

            <li>Ladle on hot broth.</li>
        
            <li>Top with a few slices of barbecue pork, fish balls and shrimp.</li>
        
            <li>Garnish with fried shallots, green onions and pork fat.</li>
